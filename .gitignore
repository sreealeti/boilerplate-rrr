# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/BareApp/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/BareApp/log/*
/BareApp/tmp/*
!/BareApp/log/.keep
!/BareApp/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/BareApp/tmp/pids/*
!/BareApp/tmp/pids/
!/BareApp/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/BareApp/storage/*
!/BareApp/storage/.keep
/BareApp/tmp/storage/*
!/BareApp/tmp/storage/
!/BareApp/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/BareApp/config/master.key
